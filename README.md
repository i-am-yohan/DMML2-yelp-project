# Yelp Data Anlaysis
Some work I did for a project where we tried to model the yelp review stars. The following shows the user how to execute the code correctly.

## Subset to Restaraunts Only
The subfolder "Spark-Subsets" is executed as follows:
```
Execute_Review_Subset.sh <input file> <Business IDs> <Output File>
```
Ensure the HDFS is up and running prior to execution.

## Stratified Sampling
This program executes the stratified sampling on a specified number of accounts.
